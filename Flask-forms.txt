So far in this code-along there is a User model, but have no special way to create
users to the website besides the terminal. We want to customize a nice looking html page, 
allowing users to register to the website. To achieve this we have to customize an HTML form,
and we need this form to be smart enough to check certain things to see if the information is valid.

Examples: Cannot create a user if there already exists one with the same name,
or if the password length does not meet the requirements of the website. 

Flask has a built-in package to create forms which allows us to display it nicer in our HTML template.

The packages to install: 

pip install flask-wtf - allows us to create nice looking forms
pip install wtforms

Then we create a forms.py file and each form will be stored there.
